// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Your pseudocode here)
.Ask user to input first number
.Read in the number(num1) user enters
.Ask user to enter another number
.Read in the number(num2) the user enters 
.Add the two numbers that the user entered (num1 + num2) 

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)
.Ask user to enter a number
.Read in the number(num1) the user enters
.If (num1 % 2 == 0)
	Print num1 is even
.Else
	Print num1 is odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.  
.Ask user to enter a number
.Read in the number and assign it to the variable num1 

.Ask user to enter a number
.Read in the number and assign it to the variable num2

.Ask user to enter a number
.Read in the number and assign it to the variable num3
 
.Ask user to enter a number
.Read in the number and assign it to the variable num4 

.Ask user to enter a number
.Read in the number and assign it to the variable num5

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
.Add (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5) and assign the value to the variable sum

.Divide (sum / 5) and assign it to the variable average

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
.Assign num1 to the variable minimum num1 = minimum

.If num2 < minimum then mimimum = num2

.If num3 < minimum then minimum = num3

.If num4 < minimum then minimum = num4

.If num5 < minimum then minimum = num5

.Assign num1 to maximum num1 = maximum

.If num2 > maximum then maximum = num2

.If num3 > maximum then maximum = num3

.If num4 > maximum then maximum = num4

.If num5 > maximum then maximum = num5

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
(Your pseudocode here)
.Print onto screen "The smallest number is " + minimum

.Print onto screen "The largest number is " + maximum
